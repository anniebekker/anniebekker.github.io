    Annie Bekker, a 20 year old UCT interactive media student is in love with digital illustration and anyone that she sees on the train. Creating her first digital sketch in MS Paint of her childhood crush, she now mixes traditional and digital, sketching people she sees in ice-cream shops and on public transport (they make for more socially acceptable <a href="https://www.instagram.com/annabelabekker/">Instagram</a> posts).
  </p>
  <p class="thimble">
    Her proudest achievements include: her extensive collection of fonts, getting 60 likes on Instagram and receiving a commission for an <a href="https://www.behance.net/annabelabe4eeb"> illustration</a> of a friend and her cat. In Matric she also received 100% for art after moulding and framing 100 copies of her extracted molar teeth.
  </p>
  <p class="thimble">
    Currently in her second year of studies, Annie hopes to pursue a career in media, graphic design or dentistry in the future.

    Annabelle Bekker, 20 years old, and personally inspired by the work of John R. Leonetti, channels her distaste for humanity into her obsession with digital illustration. Using Paint to create a pictorial hit-list before she was able to talk, Annabelle now uses digital art to vent her frustrations with people who stand too close in queues and gives A4 pages of Comic Sans text to her worst enemies. 
  </p>
  <p class=thimble>
 Choosing to isolate herself from society, Annabelle prefers deserts over dates and paintbrushes over people. Her favourite pastimes include: cooking for one, Facebook stalking without engaging and the occasional Sunday night existential crisis. 
    </p>
    <p class=thimble>
      Currently hiding away from society, Annabelle is working towards either world peace or eternal isolation.
