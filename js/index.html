       <h1>Investigating Cape Town’s budget, the alleged pro-poor city
        </h1> 
        
      
        
        <p>
            Cape Town City Mayor, Patricia de Lille, has committed the city to a budget that benefits the poor, but is the city’s pro-poor stance realised in its latest budget? Analysing the suggested 2017/2018 budget and its expenditure over various wards this question is explored. This project focuses on capital expenditure in terms of Social Services, posing 2 questions: 1. Is enough money being spent on social services? 2. Is the money distributed in a manner that benefits the poor? Capital expenditure is particularly interesting as it indicates long term investment; is Cape Town investing in those who need it?
        </p>

                The City defines poverty as:  “the percentage of people living in households with an income less than the poverty income. The poverty income is defined as the minimum monthly income needed to sustain a household and varies according to household size". In 2010, for a one person household, this number was estimated to be: R1 315.

                <p>
                  In 2010, Cape Town had a 19.7% poverty rate.
